This is a reflow oven electronics design inspired by Controleo2 project.


This project 'smart reflow oven' provides a controller composed with Arduino Leonardo board and a 'SmartReflow Shield'.

This is the initial version so I designed the PCB with some through hole elements, because I want to build the prototype with some through hole elements and a wire-wrap board, but you can use the Schematic and layout your own SMD PCB.

Thanks for Controleo2 project provide a great Arduino control program.

It's my first circuit design project, hope you enjoy it.
